## 💡 Key Projects Showcase

### 1. Firestore → BigQuery Custom ETL Pipeline (Node.js/BigQuery MERGE)
* **Tech Stack:** Node.js, Firestore, GitHub Actions, GCS, BigQuery (SQL MERGE).
* **Goal:** Replaced the deprecated official Firestore-BigQuery streaming extension.
* **Architecture:** Built a **Node.js** script with **GitHub Actions** for data extraction/staging in **GCS**.
* **Key Feature:** Developed a **BigQuery MERGE SQL** process to upsert daily transactions (~20 transactions/day) into production tables, ensuring accuracy and deduplication.

### 2. Airbnb Batch Data Pipeline (PySpark & Airflow ELT)
* **Tech Stack:** PySpark, Apache Airflow (Docker), GCS, BigQuery.
* **Process:** Used **PySpark** for complex transformations (null handling, schema normalization).
* **Orchestration:** Orchestrated the end-to-end ELT workflow using **Apache Airflow** on Docker with CeleryExecutor.
* **Impact:** Reduced manual transformation time by 95% and enabled scalable analytics.

### 3. Real-Time Streaming Pipeline with Kafka & Spark
* **Tech Stack:** Apache Kafka, PySpark Structured Streaming, PostgreSQL.
* **Goal:** Developed a real-time ingestion system for clickstream data.
* **Process:** Applied transformations like sliding window aggregations and deduplication.
* **Result:** Stored results in **PostgreSQL OLAP** for real-time dashboards, supporting A/B testing and ensuring sub-second insights.

### 4. Spotify Listening Data Pipeline (dbt & Airflow)
* **Tech Stack:** Python, PostgreSQL, dbt, Airflow, GitHub Actions, Metabase.
* **Modeling:** Used **dbt** to create models, snapshots, and incremental materializations.
* **Automation:** Automated extraction and ingestion into **PostgreSQL** using **Airflow** and **GitHub Actions**.
* **Result:** Enabled trend discovery and showcased data lineage and testing.
